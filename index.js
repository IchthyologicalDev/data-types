/*
Welcome to the Data Types Practice Exercise! This exercise will let you practice
with strings, numbers, booleans, and BigInt. There are many other data types in 
JavaScript, but these 4 are the most common when describing information. Read through
the rest of this comment for instructions, or jump right down to the requirements!

Look through this file for requirements that start with //REQUIREMENT N:
You will add your code on the line or lines that start with //TODO:

EXAMPLE:
//REQUIREMENT 1: Do Ichthyologists study fish, birds, or mammals?
//TODO: On the following line, change null to your answer. Make sure that it's a string!
let ichthyologistFocus = null;

You would change the previous line so that it says: 
let ichthyologistFocus = 'fish';

You will occasionally see longer comments (like this one) that will include extra
instruction, helpful hints, best practices, or other content. 

IMPORTANT
You should have the index.html file open in your browser as you work through this
exercise. If you aren't sure what this means, you should watch the <INSERT LINK HERE> 
video before continuing.

I hope that you get hooked on coding!
